A few years ago I read [8 steps by Esther
Gokhale](https://smile.amazon.com/TODO) {TODO}. The premise of the book
{TODO: premise?} is that over the years, especially during the past
century with rapid changes to our lifestyles {TODO: edit}, we gradually forgot how to
use our bodies. We forgot how to properly walk, sit, or even rest. We also
forgot how to build furniture that compliments our bodies and promotes
good posture. Esther Gokhale brings this forgotten knowledge back in her
book through observing people in developing countries who, despite often
working strenuous physical jobs, tend to experience much less back pain
than a typical office worker. I recommend reading the book even if you
don't have back issues (yet).

Esther Gokhale also designed a desk chair that promotes good posture
following the principles outlined in her book. While I appreciate all the
research she did, I was a bit hesitant to drop $XYZ (as of this writing)
{TODO} on a desk chair just yet so I decided to come up with a more
affordable alternative.

## What is an ergonomic chair? {TODO: better heading?}

Many chairs are marketed as "ergonomic" but are they really? According to
Esther Gokhale {TODO: find other refs}, not really. A truly ergonomic
chair should help our body maintain its most neutral sitting position.
Without going into too many details, our vertebrae {TODO: spelling} should
stack on top of one another, and our spine should form a gentle S shape.
Our shoulders should not be hunched {TODO: podkulone?} and resting.
Contrary to the popular belief, this means a chair should not be one where
we lean back, lounge, and rest our arms on armrests. An ergonomic desk
chair promoting good posture should:

* not be too deep so that our back can reach the back rest,
* have a small back rest supporting our lower back without pushing our
  shoulders forward,
* not have armrests,
* have a flat base (parallel to the floor) and a backrest that doesn't
  recline back so that the base together with the backrest form an L shape.


## Ikea Bleckberget

[Bleckberget](https://ikea) {TODO} is a very affordable chair from Ikea,
currently at $XY {TODO}, stylized as a basic office chair from the 70s
{TODO: verify}. It meets almost all the criteria mentioned above, except
for the last one: flat base and straight backrest. Fortunatelly, this can
be easily remedied {TODO: improved?}.

## The fix

You will need a few things from the hardware store (shouldn't cost more
than a few dollars):
